# Snake Client Project

Snake is a game that was popular when Pong was going out of fashion and brickbreaker was yet to become a thing. The idea is to grow the snake as much as possible by eating the nuggets that appear at random positions in the game's grid. The more the snake eats, the bigger it gets. The game ends when the user crashes into a wall or the snake eats itself. 

Feature to be added later: autocontrol.
